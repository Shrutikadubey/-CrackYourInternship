//problem;Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
//Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

//solution:
stringstream ss(s);
        vector<string> words;
        string word;
        while (ss >> word) {
            words.push_back(word);
        }
        string reversed;
        for (int i = words.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed += words[i] + " ";
        }
        return reversed.substr(0, reversed.size() - 1);
